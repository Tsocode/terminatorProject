# terminatorProject
using Brute Force in Python I was able to create a tic-tac-toe 10 X 10 board that never loses against a human it plays.
First PvP file helped me know the strategies to use by testing player vs player strategies.
Second PvC file used the data having the best strategies to help mimic the movements to be made by the A.I(CPU) inorder to never lose when playing agaisnt a human
Additional Information: Inorder to win pieces have to be in a straight line of 5 similar pieces either diagonally, horizontally or vertically.
